By looking more carefully at the invariant and coinvariant sublattices for the involutions, one can easily note some discrepancies with the original classification presented in Table 5 of [2]. For this we use the function `type` (we refer to [1] for the definition of a type of a pair $(L, f)$). In the case of involutions, the ''type'' encodes the genus of the invariant and coinvariant sublattices of the isometry (as well as the genus of the lattice it acts on)."

    "### Table 2\n",
    "In order to reproduce Table 2 from [2], we need to recover the possible coinvariant sublattices of the second type of involutions of $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$ (i.e. whose invariant sublattice has signature $(2,\\ast)$), and we need to collect the abstract isometry class of the complement of a primitive vector of square $4$ in such lattices. To do so, we use the OSCAR function `primitive_embeddings` which features the algorithm described by Nikulin in the proof of Proposition 1.15.1 in [3]. This algorithm have been implemented in OSCAR by the second named author."

    "### Table 3\n",
    "Table 3 is slightly more complicated to reproduce, and we will see now how to do it. It is done in several steps:\n",
    "- The list of 22 potential coinvariant sublattices $S$ we have computed before contains redundancy; meaning that we have obtained lattices which are abtractly isometric. So first, we need to filter this list to keep only one representative for each isometry class;\n",
    "- Second, for a given lattice $S$ computed as before, we determine a complete set of representatives for the equivalence classes  of primitive embeddings of $S$ into the OG6-lattice $\\mathbf{L} := \\mathbf{U}^{\\oplus3}\\oplus [-2]^{\\oplus2}$ (equivalence up to the left and right actions of $O(\\mathbf{L})$ and $O(S)$);\n",
    "- Third, we determine the isometry class of each possible orthogonal complement and we isolate one representative for each isometry class (in order to avoid duplicates in the table);\n",
    "- Last, for each possible isometry class $T$ of an orthogonal complement, we determine whether there exists an involution $\\mathbf{L}$ with invariant sublattice $T$ and coinvariant sublattice $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first step, we use the result from the previous part: Since we work with indefinite lattices, it suffices to compare genera and make sure that each genus consists of a unique isometry class (which is always the case in our situation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second step, we call again `primitive_embeddings`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the third step, we apply similar methods as in the first step, applied to the results of the second step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last step, we use the information of the second step. Each entry in the output of `primitive_embeddings` will be of the form $(L', S', T)$ where $L'$ is isometric to $\\mathbf{L}$ (technically in the same genus, but this genus consists of a unique isometry class), $S'$ is isometric to the lattice $S$ we have chosen, and $T$ is the orthogonal complement of $S'$ in $L'$. Then, for this particular primitive extension $S'\\oplus T\\subseteq L'$, there exists an involution of $L'$ with $S'$ and $T$ as coinvariant and invariant sublattices respectively, if and only if, the associated glue map is defined on $\\mathbb{F}_2$-vector spaces (well-known condition for gluing invariant and coinvariant sublattices of an involution). Using the function `glue_map` from Hecke, this can be checked directly from our outputs, and thus we can decide which pairs $(S, T)$ in Table 3 can be decorated by a trefoil $\\clubsuit$."

    "From what was done above, we have therefore found that there are exactly 11 pairs $(S, T)$, up to compenentwise isometry, such that there exists an involution of $\\mathbf{L}$ acting nontrivially on $\\mathbf{L}^{\\sharp}$, with coinvariant sublattice isometric to $S$ and invariant sublattice isometric to $T$. Table 4 in [2] gives explicit examples for 6 of such isometries, meaning that 5 were in fact missing. The best way to reconstruct this table, as in the corrigendum, is to give the isometries in terms of matrices (for their action on the usual basis of $\\mathbf{U}^{\\oplus3}\\oplus[-2]^{\\oplus2}$) and check that they have the correct invariant and coinvariant sublattices (up to isometry). We follow the new numbering in Table 4 of the corrigendum.\n",
